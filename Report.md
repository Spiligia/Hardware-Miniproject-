While putting together our project, we initially started by taking the Raspberry pi out of the kit and setting it up. After attaching the needed heat syncs,
and accesories to make it capable of being controlled, we attached it to a desktop monitor and began setup. We installed the Pi OS into a micro usb we bought
off amazon. Setup in this regard was fairly easy. We had to change the default password after reading the notification that hackers actively watched the BU 
network looking for new Raspberry Pi's and quickly reformatted the password. We then began the process of installing python and the neccesary libraries in 
the computer.

In the process of setting up the Pi, we ran into difficulties regarding libraries that were needed however we were able to figure out which were missing and
install them. Additionally, we were not aware plotting our data, which was retrieved in the lab by the highway, was not possible on the Pi, and had to first
be transferred to a laptop. We noticed this after the date format kept returning date errors and after we could not figure out why we checked the Github. We
realized this was due to the fact the code was not linux friendly. Once this was done however getting out graph was fairly easy. A photo is attached below.
